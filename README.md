# GoucherDining
A demo dining hall nutrition app for wp 8.1


##1	CHALLENGE

**Primary:** Goucher College has five dining halls but no quick way to tell when each dining hall is open or what is being served at a given time.

**Secondary:** Many students workout at Goucher’s Gym facilities and want to bulk up or lose weight. However there is no easy way to keeping track of what and how much they should eat for optimal results. 

##2	SOLUTION
**Primary:** Build a windows phone app that seamlessly allows users to find out what dining halls are open and what is being served.

**Secondary:** Allow students to calculate how many calories they should eat based on their current weight, age and workout goal. Then suggest combinations of meal items and portions that will allow students to keep to a given diet on their meal plan.
